# Roadmap

Track near-term investments and longer-range ideas for the IaC-to-Visual platform.

## Recent Milestones
- Unified CI/CD into the AI-enhanced workflow with mock apply plus artifact publishing.
- Delivered the online-banking reference stack with autogenerated diagrams and tests.
- Added coverage enforcement and reporting to every Terratest run.

## Next Up
- Expand stack catalog beyond online banking (e.g., data pipelines, event-driven services).
- Wire acceptance-criteria validation against Jira issues during pull-request reviews.
- Publish coverage results to an external service and surface a README badge.
- Harden generated tests to cover more edge cases discovered during demos.

## Future Ideas
- Bidirectional visual-to-IaC generation to round out the platform experience.
- Richer AI code review that maps findings to architecture diagrams and test results.
- Opinionated policy-as-code pack that ships with the diagram/test generation toolkit.
