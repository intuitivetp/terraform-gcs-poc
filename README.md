Convert Terraform into living architecture diagrams, autogenerated tests, and CI-powered documentation. This proof of concept demonstrates AI-assisted remediation inside a fully automated GitHub workflow.

## Highlights
- Terraform state parser feeds Mermaid diagrams for architecture, network, and data-flow views.
- Python tooling synthesizes Terratest suites and keeps coverage above 70% in CI.
- GitHub Actions pipeline stitches validation, testing, mock/real applies, and artifact publishing together.
- Gemini-powered self-healing fixes safe issues (formatting, obvious syntax errors) and annotates anything requiring manual follow-up.

## Quick Start
- Prerequisites: Terraform ≥ 1.5.0, Python ≥ 3.11, Go ≥ 1.21, Make (optional), and a GCP project if you plan to run real applies.
- Clone and prepare:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/intuitivetp/terraform-gcs-poc.git
  cd terraform-gcs-poc
  chmod +x scripts/*.py scripts/*.sh
  ```
- Run the demo end-to-end: `make demo` (or follow the manual steps in `docs/getting-started.md`).
- Trigger the workflow: push to `main`/`develop` or run **Actions → IaC to Visual Pipeline (AI-Enhanced)**.
- Download the `demo-bundle` artifact from any run to grab diagrams, coverage, and generated tests without reproducing them locally.
- Need a full GCP apply? Dispatch the workflow with `run_real_apply=true` (see `docs/ci-pipeline.md`) after supplying credentials and state bucket secrets.

## Demo & Workflow
